Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with environment

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: The dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used to make predictions
- Labels: The target variable we want to predict
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
